Usage Examples
======================

The examples directory includes both **standalone python scripts** and **jupyter notebooks** to help you get started. (NB: Currently there are only scripts and no notebooks TODO).


Python Scripts
-------------------------------------------

The scripts are located in examples/python. For testing purposes all examples can be run using the run_examples.py script located in the root directory. Some scripts have an example flag that selects alternative input data or estimators.


Jupyter Notebooks
-------------------------------------------



Open Risk Academy Scripts
