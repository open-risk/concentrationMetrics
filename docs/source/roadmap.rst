Roadmap
============================

concentrationMetrics aims to become the reference python implementation for all widely used concentration and diversity
indices and metrics. This roadmap lays out the upcoming steps in this journey.

An indicative list of future functionality to be implemented sometime within 2021

v0.6.xx
------------------------

* Network / Graph concentration indexes
* Further data sets to support network analysis

v0.7.xx
------------------------

* Spatial concentration indexes (distance based measures)
    * G-statistics, G*-statistics
    * Moran's I
    * Geary's C
    * Greenwood statistic
* Further visualization functionality

v0.8.xx
------------------------

* The aggregate data edge case (when part of the dataset has only aggregate, not individual data)
* Semantic self-documentation of metrics
* Focus on documentation
